# Helvetica bot

Code is messy as hell and in many cases began as copy pasta, don't judge me, I'll clean it up one day

## Thanks to [Darius Kazemi](https://github.com/dariusk) for the original Twitter bot inspo

This bot started as a fork from the hilarious [bracket meme bot](https://github.com/dariusk/bracket-meme-bot). There is a really good [blog post](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/bracket-meme-bot/) explaining how Darius came up with the algorithm to make it work. I definitely recommend giving it a read!

## Thanks to [Monica Powell](https://github.com/M0nica/bluesky-artbot) and [Phil Nash](https://github.com/philnash/bsky-bot) for inspo when resurrecting the bot on Bluesky

Monica's repo helped me figure out how to post images to Bluesky and Phil's showed me how to use Github actions to keep Helvetica bot running.
