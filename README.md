This bot started as a fork from the hilarious [bracket meme bot](https://github.com/dariusk/bracket-meme-bot). There is a really good [blog post](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/bracket-meme-bot/) explaining how Darius came up with the algorithm to make it work. I definitely recommend giving it a read!
